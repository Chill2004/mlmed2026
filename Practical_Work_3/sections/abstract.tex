This report studies infection region segmentation for COVID-19 chest X-ray images using the COVID-QU-Ex dataset. The goal is to predict a binary mask that highlights the infection area in each input image. Because the dataset is large, we only use the COVID-19 subset for training and evaluation. We implement a U-Net segmentation model and train it with binary cross-entropy loss. We evaluate the model mainly with training curves and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on both training and validation sets. The results show that U-Net can learn meaningful infection patterns, but the segmentation quality is still affected by class imbalance and unclear boundaries in X-ray images.
