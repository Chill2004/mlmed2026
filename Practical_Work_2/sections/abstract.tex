\begin{abstract}
Head circumference (HC) is an important fetal biometric used in prenatal ultrasound to assess fetal growth and estimate gestational age.
This report studies automatic HC measurement using the HC18 dataset of 2D fetal head ultrasound images.
We build a single deep learning regression model based on ResNet-18 to predict head circumference in millimeters.
The model uses both the ultrasound image and the provided pixel size (mm/pixel) to handle scale differences across acquisitions.
We evaluate the approach using mean absolute error (MAE) and perform basic hyperparameter experiments to improve performance.
