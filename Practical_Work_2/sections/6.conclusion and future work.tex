\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this report, we presented a deep learning regression method for predicting fetal head circumference from 2D ultrasound images using the HC18 dataset.
We implemented a ResNet-18-based regressor that takes both the ultrasound image and the pixel size (mm/pixel) as input, and we trained the model with MAE loss.
The best validation MAE achieved in our experiments is \textbf{11.315 mm}.
Future work may focus on segmentation-based measurement pipelines, improved preprocessing of the scanning region, and ensembling methods to further reduce error.
