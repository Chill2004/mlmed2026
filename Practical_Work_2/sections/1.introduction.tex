\section{Introduction}
Fetal head circumference (HC) is a common measurement in pregnancy ultrasound because it helps doctors monitor fetal growth and make clinical decisions.
Normally, HC is measured by choosing the correct head view and fitting an ellipse along the skull boundary.
However, this manual process takes time and the results may differ between operators.

In this lab, we build one machine learning/deep learning model to predict fetal head circumference directly from ultrasound images using a regression approach.
We use the HC18 dataset and evaluate the model with mean absolute error (MAE) in millimeters.
Our method is based on a ResNet-18 network adapted for grayscale ultrasound images.
In addition, we include the pixel size (mm/pixel) as an input so the model can handle different image scales and produce HC values in real units.
